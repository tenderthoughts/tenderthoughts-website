I don't know what's separating us... I don't know what sort of glass barrier is between us... I feel very lonely üòî and suffocated.

I wish I could go back in time... So that I could make things right for both of us.

I overthink...and that's what trouble me the most..

I don't know what's in his mind... everyone says it's difficult to read a woman's mind.. but it's far more difficult to read a man's.

I wish he talk it out to me so that I won't be in doubt.. my mind is just a mixture of emotions... I don't know if I'm sad angry or confused. I'm just blank and I overthink..

But I wish he knew how much I love and care for him...he is not my boyfriend..he is my husband.. my everything my whole life revolves around him... He means a lot to me...
